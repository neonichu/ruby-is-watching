# Ruby is watching

An introduction on developing WatchKit and Android Wear apps using RubyMotion. We'll learn about the differences between both platforms, what kind of possibilities the smartwatches bring to extending your application and how to share some code for your watch app between both iOS and Android versions.

Talk given at [#inspect 2015](http://conference.rubymotion.com).
